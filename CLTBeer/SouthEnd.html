			<p class="webtext">
				<strong>Sycamore Brewing Company</strong> <br>
				Extremely popular brewery located on Hawkins Street. Hosts Food Truck Friday every Friday where there are several food trucks selling
				affordable food to the patrons. There is even live music at this event along with others. Great selection of specifically IPAs and
				Blondes. It is so popular that often times it feels too crowded inside. The actually brewery is not too large, but they make up for it with the amazing beer.
				Grab a date and head to Food Truck Friday for a great time!

				<strong>Lenny Boy Brewing Company</strong> <br>
				Located on South Tryon Street. Spacious brewery that is kind of tucked away alongside the street. This brewery has been around for decades, and
				it certainly does not dissapoint. The beer selection is not as large as other breweries but it is quality over quantity. Very laid back atmosphere
				that any person would enjoy. This brewery has a good sour beer selection, and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.

		<h3>Wooden Robot</h3>
		<div>
			<p class="webtext">
				<strong>Wooden Robot Brewery</strong> <br>
				Located on South Tryon Street. The establishment itself is small, but the beer is nice. Its' popularity makes it more cramped because there is always
				an abundance of people. Extensive menu to go along with the drinks. The patio is very small and often times too cramped to stand outside.
				A wonderful place that needs an expansion because of its' popularity.
